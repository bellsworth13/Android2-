# Android2-

 This is my impressionist application for the Android 2 assignment. 

The initial skeleton code was already given for the project. The layout of the app allows the user to upload the photo on the left and paint (using their finger) an impressionist drawing on the right. There is a selection of photos to choose from. There is also a tool bar at the bottom of the application. The buttons are as follows: download images, load image, brush, clear, save, and share. The first two buttons also the user to download images and load one of them onto the screen. The brush button has 5 different options: a circle brush, a square brush, a circle speed brush, a square speed brush, and a dot splatter brush. The user can choose any of the 5 to draw with. There is also a clear button that will clear the drawing, leaving the image on the screen, so that the user can start a new impressionist drawing. Lastly, the save and share buttons at the bottom allow the user to save their drawing to their photo gallery and to share their photos with others, directly from the app.
